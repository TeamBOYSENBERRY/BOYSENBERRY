#About the project
The BOYSENBERRY team project is a simple, pure HTML/CSS/JS website, dedicated to all the lonely Software University guys out there. 

It provides a funny collection of pickup lines/openers, some video materials and a diary-section/testimonial with our fictional pickup master Pesho the dev, who naild it (you know, the love of his life)!
