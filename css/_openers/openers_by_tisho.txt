I have a job for you, but it blows.

Roses are red, Twitter is blue. You look bangable, so I'll follow you.

Liquor is not the only hard thing around here.

You’re hotter than Papa Bear’s porridge.

Your daddy must be a drug dealer, cuz you're dope.

Baby, you're like a student and I am like a math book; you solve all my problems.

I have a pen, You have a phone number. Think of the possibilities.

I wish I could select all of your clothes and press delete.

How can I love you if you won’t lay down?

Baby, you're as hot as the bottom of my laptop.

Are you related to Yoda? Cause yodalicious.

If I followed you home, would you keep me?

Tell me about yourself, your dreams, your ambitions, your phone number.

Съжалявам, на мен ли говореше?"Не."Well then, please start.

Можеш ли да хванеш моят exception, защото I'm falling in teamwork with you!
